Tk::PathEntry Module

This is an alternative to classic file selection dialogs. It's just an
Entry widget which can do file completion using the <Tab> key like in
modern shells.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

For Windows NT and ActiveState Perl, replace "make" with "nmake", if
you have the Visual C++ compiler available or have nmake installed on
your system. Otherwise, just copy PathEntry.pm to C:\Perl\lib\site\Tk.
